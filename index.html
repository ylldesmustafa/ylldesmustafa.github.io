        <p>My name is Ylldes Mustafa. I am 24-years-old and live in Chicago, Illinois with my husband, and our gray and white cat, Lola.</p>
    
        <p>I went to school at DePaul University in Chicago where I studied journalism. I received both of my bachelors and masters degrees from DePaul in journalism. During my time at DePaul, I worked for the school's student broadcast news station, Good Day DePaul, where I anchored, reported and produced daily news stories.</p>

        <p>I am looking to make a career switch into web development and have created this portfolio to showcase my work.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Working Out</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Hanging out with my family</li>
            
          </ul>
